Imagine we are interested in analysing the occcurence of different species of water beetle in different land cover types

The land cover image below is one tile from the [Copernicus global land cover](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/content/annual-100m-global-land-cover-maps-available) map, which is available annually from 2015-2019 and has a 100m cell size

It was downloaded from the [Global Land Cover Viewer](https://lcviewer.vito.be/)
