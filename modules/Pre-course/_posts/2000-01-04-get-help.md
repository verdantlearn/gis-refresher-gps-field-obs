## Where to get help
If you're struggling with any of the tasks, the first place to post is in the [**Help Area**](https://padlet.com/VerdantLearn_LT/GISRefresher2_HelpArea_May2021) :raised_hand: below.  Your tutor will check this page several times/day, but you may also get support from your peers.  We ask that those of you who are confident doing the tasks check this page occasionally, to help our little learning community all move forward together.  Thank you!

If you're not sure what you should be doing at any point, you can also post a question there and we will clarify.

If there is a problem you'd prefer to discuss in private, you can email Lucy on `lucy dot tallents at verdantlearn dot com`.  Please be aware that she may take up to 36 hours to respond, given time zone differences and her other responsibilities.
