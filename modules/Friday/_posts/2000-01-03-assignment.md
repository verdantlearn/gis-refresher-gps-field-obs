## Your mini assignment
*20 minutes*

Submit a mini assignment to demonstrate your progress this week, comprised of two elements:
> 1. A description of your experience alongside a screenshot of your dataset in QGIS
> 2. Feedback to one of your peers (next page)

<br>

You can complete this assignment *even if you didn't succeed* in combining your GPS locations and field records!  

Simply describe how far you managed to get, or omit the screenshot and adapt your answers as suggested below.

It's just as important for us to talk about failure as success in our work, and figure out how we can learn from it together.  It may be that you haven't collected your field data yet, or you need to spend more time preparing your field records before using them in a GIS project.  We appreciate your honesty, and will harness it to improve the support we offer to help other conservationists succeed!

### Showcase your own work
Please include the following in **your own Padlet post**:
1. The **title** of your mini project
2. **Your name**
3. A **screenshot** of QGIS showing your chosen dataset (*optional*).  You can upload this to your post after clicking on the pink '`+`' button - click the up arrow button to Upload, and choose your screenshot
4. One sentence **describing your dataset**.  What data, from which source?  If you didn't find suitable data, briefly state where you looked
5. One sentence **assessing its suitability** for your purpose.  Does it fit your needs?  What shortcomings does it have?  If you didn't find a dataset, explain why the data you *did* look at where unsuitable
6. One sentence reflecting on **your feelings** about this experience.  What was your experience doing the week's tasks?  Do you feel empowered, more confident, curious or excited, or do you feel frustrated, confused, disheartened, or another emotion?  Why do you feel this way?  
7. One sentence on your **next steps**.  How might you build on what you've achieved this week, and take your efforts forward?
